#### An analysis of Financial Inclusion in East Africa
#### By Deborah Masibo
## Description

Financial inclusion is one of the main obstacles to Africa's economic development. In East Africa, only 13.9% (9.1 million) of the adult population have access to, or use a commercial bank account.

Bank accounts are a good indicator of a country's financial inclusion, therefore, this study aims to predict which individuals are most likely to have or use a bank account. The study will be restricted to Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and Rwanda.

## Technologies Used
Programming language: Python              
Pyhton libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scipy and Scikit-Learn.  
Software: Google Colabolatory
